    <h1>Agile Methodology</h1>

    <p>
    <h2>Overview and The Stages</h2>
    <p>
    The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilised in software development.
    The six stages are:
    <ol>
        <li>Requirements - the team scopes out and prioritises tasks while gathering the requirements of their project.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Plan - the team split up the work and plan the project.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Design - UX designers and developers take part in this stage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Develop - the team works on the first iteration of the project, with the goal of having a working product to
            launch at the end of the sprint.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Release - the system must be tested, any defects must be addressed, the system must be finalised
            and user documentation completed, then the iteration will be released into production.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Track and Monitor - this stage involves support for the software release, the system should be monitored and
            kept running smoothly.
            The production phase ends when support has ended or when the release is planned for retirement.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Scrum Sprints</h2>
    <p>
    In the Agile Lifecycle, the work is divided into sprints. These sprints normally last 2 weeks. At the beginning of a
    sprint a goal should be discussed that should
    then be met at the end of the sprint. User stories should be chosen to support the goal that was set. The user stories
    should then be broken down into specific
    tasks developers can cary out. A sprint backlog should also be created.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are three different roles defined in scrum. These are the Scrum Master, the Product Owner and the Scrum Team.
    <br>
    The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.
    <br>
    The Product Owners primary goal is to represent the customer to the development team, the PO is responsible for the success of a product and for maximizing the value of that product.
    <br>
    The Scrum Team carry out the development tasks that were agreed on during the planning
    stage.
