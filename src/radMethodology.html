    <h1>RAD Methodology</h1>

    <p>
    <h2>Overview and The Stages</h2>
    <p>
        The RAD Method is a particular approach to software development which is
        used for rapid prototyping and iterative delivery of software.

        <u>R</u>apid <u>A</u>pplication <u>D</u>evelopment generally follows a cyclical(repeated) process of four basic steps::
    <ol>
        <li>Planning Requirements - During this initial stage designers, developers, and users come to a rough agreement on project scope and application requirements, so that future stages with prototyping can begin.</li>

        <li>User Design - User feedback is gathered with heavy emphasis on determining the system architecture. This allows initial modeling and prototypes to be created. This step is repeated as often as necessary as the project evolves.</li>

        <li>Rapid Construction - Once basic user and system design has begun, the construction phase is where most of the actual application coding, testing, and integration takes place. Along with User Design, the Rapid Construction phase is repeated as often as necessary, as new components are required or alterations are made to meet the needs of the project.</li>

        <li>Develop - the team works on the first iteration of the project, with the goal of having a working product to
            launch at the end of the sprint.
        </li>

        <li>Cutover - The final Cutover (or Transition) stage allows the development team time to move components to a live production environment, where any necessary full-scale testing or team training can take place.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Pros</h2>
    <p>
        While there are a number of benefits to using a rapid application development method, we’ve highlighted a handful of the most crucial when considering whether RAD is the right choice for your next project.

        Measurable Progress: With frequent iterations, components, and prototypes coming down the pipe, progress on the overall project, as well as lesser segments, can be easily measured and evaluated to maintain schedules and budgets.
        Quickly Generate Productive Code: As a larger percentage of active software developers move into multi-discipline roles (i.e. full-stack developers), a RAD methodology allows skilled team members to quickly produce prototypes and working code to illustrate examples that might otherwise take weeks or months to see the light of day using a slower development technique.
        Compartmentalization of System Components: Much in the same way that object-oriented programming practices keep objects and components quarantined from one another, RAD inherently has the same beneficial impact on the components generated during development. By forcing designers and developers to create components that are functional and independent on their own, to be used in an iterative release or prototype, each element within the overall software system is compartmentalized and therefore easily modified as the needs of the software evolve.
        Rapid, Constant User Feedback: As discussed above, obtaining relevant user feedback during development is invaluable. RAD methodologies allow for near-constant user interfacing and feedback through frequent iterations and prototype releases, giving the entire team priceless evaluation and criticism when it’s needed most.
        Early Systems Integration: While most waterfall method software projects must, by their very nature, wait until the tail end of the lifecycle to begin integrations with other systems or services, a rapidly developed application becomes integrated almost immediately. By requiring early integrations within a prototype, a RAD system quickly identifies any errors or complications within integrations and forces immediate resolutions.
        Simple Adaptability: During development, software is a fairly malleable form. Since code can be changed that dramatically alters the entire system or generates new components, it is to the advantage of the development team to make use of this flexibility early and often, by iterating and prototyping potential concepts or ideas throughout development.

    <h2>Cons</h2>
    <p>
        No software development method is without fault and RAD is no different. While the benefits typically outweigh the disadvantages, we’ll examine a few of the most likely roadblocks when implementing RAD into a new project.

        Requires Modular Systems: Since each component within the system should be iterable and testable on its own accord, the overall system design when using RAD requires that each component be modular, allowing elements to be swapped in and out or altered by a variety of team members.
        Difficulty Within Large-Scale Projects: While rapid application development methods lead to far greater flexibility during the design and development process, it will also tend to reduce control and restrictions. While this isn’t inherently negative, properly managing this added flexibility and volatility within the scope of the whole project can be difficult for larger applications.
        Demands Frequent User Interfacing: Gaining user insight and feedback early and often is certainly a benefit from a design perspective, but this double-edged sword requires that the team be both willing and able to communicate with users on a much more frequent basis, in comparison to a typical waterfall development method.
        Depends Upon Skilled Developers: While many developers these days are multi-disciplined, it is worth noting that use of RAD techniques does require a greater overall skill across the development team, in order to quickly adapt as the system and components evolve.
