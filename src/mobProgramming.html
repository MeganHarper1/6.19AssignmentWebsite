<h1>Pair Programming vs Mob Programming</h1>
<br>

<h2>Advantages of Pair programming</h2>
<br>
<p>
    CODE QUALITY: pairs of programmers have a higher chance of catching problems earlier before they become deep within
    a lot of code
    <br>
    ROBUST SOLUTIONS: software can cause many problems with lots of different solutions, having multiple coders allows
    for more ideas which can lead to better decisions.
    <br>
    DEV COMMUNICATIONS: pairing allows for more knowledge to be shared between developers meaning code isn't sectioned
    out to each persons specialities, reducing internal confusion.
    <br>
    KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: pairing is a great way for less experienced programmers to gain knowledge and develop their
    skills as they work alongside someone more advanced in the codebase.
</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Pair Programming</h2>
<br>
<p>
    HIGHER COSTS: Obviously as 2 programmers are working on the one keyboard this results in less committed code
    resulting in higher cost per line written. However lines of code written doesn't matter if it isn't well written.
    <br>
    MIXED RESULTS: various people hold different results on pairing some people just dont work well together so it
    certainly isn't for everybody.
    <br>
    LEADER: having an experienced coder and a less experienced coder together has its benefits however it can lead to
    one person dominating the keyboard and not allowing input of the other.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Mob Programming</h2>
<br>
<p>
    KNOWLEDGE SHARING INCREASED: mobbing helps bring every programmer up to the same level it allows for a very even team and can lead to very good code being written
    <br>
    NO OVERHEAD: obviously there is still a boss however having a mob brings everyone together almost as one programmer and any queries can be raised then and there without having to wait for a stand-up or a pbr ect
    <br>
    ANYONE CAN GO TO THE MEETINGS: as everyone works as one the knowledge is equal so somebody at the team for 3 month or 12 months would have the same recent knowledge and can attend the stand-up to say where the team is instead of all 10 people!
    <br>
</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Mob Programming</h2>
<br>
<p>
    NOT FOR EVERYONE: not everyone is suited to a mob it requires you to be outgoing and able to put points across, extreme introverts this isn't for you.
    <br>
    OVER DOMINANT PERSONALITIES:  some people dont suit being in a mob due to their more ego based personalities these people prefer doing everything themselves and struggle to stick to the allotted time on the keyboard in mobs.
    <br>
    PROBLEMS: if a problem in the code arises and truly nobody understands it then this can cause allot of sitting around staring at the screen waisting recourses.
